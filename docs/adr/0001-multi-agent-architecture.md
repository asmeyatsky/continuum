# ADR 0001: Multi-Agent Architecture for Concept Exploration

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Context
The Continuum system needs to explore concepts through multiple dimensions: research, connections, content generation, visualization, multimedia, and validation. A single monolithic approach would be brittle, difficult to maintain, and inflexible for adding new exploration strategies.

## Decision
We adopt a **multi-agent architecture** where each exploration aspect is handled by a specialized agent (ResearchAgent, ConnectionAgent, ContentGenerationAgent, VisualAgent, MultimediaAgent, ValidationAgent) coordinated by an AgentManager.

## Architecture
```
AgentManager (Orchestrator)
├── ResearchAgent (facts, sources, academic papers)
├── ConnectionAgent (analogies, cross-domain links)
├── ContentGenerationAgent (summaries, explanations)
├── VisualAgent (diagrams, infographics)
├── MultimediaAgent (audio, video content)
└── ValidationAgent (fact-checking, quality control)
```

## Rationale

### Separation of Concerns
- Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Agents can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Easy to understand and reason about each agent's behavior

### Extensibility
- New agents can be added without modifying existing code
- Agents follow a common interface (BaseAgent)
- Easy to swap implementations (mock for testing, real for production)

### Parallelization
- Agents can execute tasks concurrently
- Multiple agents can explore different dimensions simultaneously
- Reduces overall exploration latency

### Testing & Mocking
- Each agent can be tested independently
- Mock agents enable offline development and testing
- Real agents can be integrated incrementally

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ System is highly modular and testable
- ✅ Easy to add new exploration strategies
- ✅ Agents can be optimized independently
- ✅ Clear interfaces enable easy replacement/upgrades
- ✅ Natural parallelization opportunities

### Negative
- ⚠️ Requires coordination overhead (AgentManager)
- ⚠️ Potential for inconsistent results across agents
- ⚠️ More complex system than monolithic approach
- ⚠️ Needs careful orchestration to avoid conflicts

### Mitigations
- Implement ValidationAgent to detect and flag inconsistencies
- Use consistent prompts/models across agents
- Define clear domain models (ConceptNode) for agent communication
- Comprehensive integration tests
